Code designed to intake telemetry data from the Tracing Insights GitHub repository. 
- The program prompts the user to select a year and a race from that year, then iterates through all drivers and laps for that race, downloading the telemetry data for each lap and saving it.
- The program uses the FastF1 API to obtain the schedule and session information, and the requests library to fetch the telemetry data from the GitHub repository. 
- The telemetry data is saved in a directory structure organized by event name and driver abbreviation.
